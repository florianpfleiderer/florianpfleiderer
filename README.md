## Hi there, I'm Florian Pfleiderer!

<p><em>
I'm a Masters student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/">University of St. Andrews</a>. <br>
Among top 15% of my student cohort during undergraduate time at the <a href="https://www.tuwien.at/en/">Technical University of Vienna</a>, I was following an individual study plan, taking courses in Robotics, Machine Vision and Software Engineering. <br>
I was part of <a href="https://www.tuwienracing.at/">TU Wien racing</a>, where I led the embedded software development of the racecar's electronic control unit and helped the team secure a top 25 place among over 200 competing teams.

### ðŸŒ± My best projects ...

- <img align="right" src="assets/cyws3d.png" width="150"><a href="https://github.com/florianpfleiderer/CYWS3D-pipeline">Model Optimisation and Comparison for Improved Change Detection in Autonomous Systems</a> â€“ This thesis enhances change detection in indoor mobile robots by directly applying the CYWS-3D model to camera data, eliminating the reconstruction step. This approach addresses issues with occluded objects and search area definitions, serving as an indicator for objects missed by existing pipelines, thus improving unsupervised home assistance applications.

- <img align="right" src="assets/simplesynth.png" width="150"><a href="https://github.com/florianpfleiderer/SimpleSynth">Digital Modular Synthesizer</a> â€“ The motivation for this project was to develop a modular synthesizer to produce different sounds and create short loops to use in music production. It utilises the ImNodes and ImGui libraries for generation and the Synthesis Toolkit (STK) for creating and processing sounds.

- <img align="right" src="assets/arhs.png" width="150"><a href="https://github.com/florianpfleiderer/ARHS">Autonomous Robot Hockey System</a> â€“ Autonomous Robot Hockey System (ARHS) - A ROS-based software for autonomous robots to play a hockey-like game. Key tasks include motion control, obstacle avoidance, detecting field components (pucks, poles, goals), field dimension detection, localisation, and puck manipulation.

#### Other projects
- object detection & path planning on Pioneer-3DX mobile robot platform
- racecar Laptime Simulation in ChassisSim
