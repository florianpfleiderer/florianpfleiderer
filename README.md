## Hi there, I'm Florian Pfleiderer!

<p><em>
I hold a Masterâ€™s Degree with Distinction in Computer Science from the 
<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/">University of St Andrews</a>, 
where I focused on machine learning, multi-core programming, and data-intensive systems. 
My masterâ€™s thesis centered on model-based reinforcement learning, exploring sample-efficient methods for decision-making and control in dynamic environments. <br>
During my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering and Communication Technologies at the 
<a href="https://www.tuwien.at/en/">Technical University of Vienna</a>, 
I ranked among the top 15% of my cohort while following an individual study plan with a strong emphasis on Robotics, Machine Vision, Software Engineering, and Automation. <br>
I was also part of <a href="https://www.tuwienracing.at/">TU Wien Racing</a>, where I led embedded software development for the racecarâ€™s electronic control unit and contributed to securing a top-25 place among over 200 international teams. <br>
My interests lie in applied AI, reinforcement learning, robotics, and systems programming, with a focus on building intelligent and efficient autonomous systems.
</em></p>

### ðŸŒ± My best projects ...

- <img align="right" src="assets/cyws3d.png" width="150"><a href="https://github.com/florianpfleiderer/CYWS3D-pipeline">Model Optimisation and Comparison for Improved Change Detection in Autonomous Systems</a> â€“ This thesis integrates the CYWS-3D model into an existing research project to enhance change detection for indoor mobile robots. The system leverages DINO-pretrained Vision Transformers for feature extraction, SuperGlue graph neural networks for correspondence matching, and UNet architectures with SCSE attention for spatial processing. By applying CenterNet object detection heads with differentiable 3D warping directly to camera data, the approach bypasses traditional reconstruction pipelines. The multi-modal architecture addresses occlusion handling and search area optimization through geometric registration modules, serving as a complementary indicator for objects missed by conventional detection systems in unsupervised home assistance applications.

- <img align="right" src="assets/simplesynth.png" width="150"><a href="https://github.com/florianpfleiderer/SimpleSynth">Digital Modular Synthesizer</a> â€“ SimpleSynth is a modular, node-based synthesizer for music production featuring real-time sound generation and processing. Users create synthesizer patches by connecting visual modules (oscillators, effects, sequencers) through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Built with ImNodes/ImGui for the GUI and STK for audio processing, it offers educational accessibility while maintaining professional capabilities. The system supports save/load functionality, real-time parameter adjustment, and easy extensibility for custom modules.

- <img align="right" src="assets/arhs.png" width="150"><a href="https://github.com/florianpfleiderer/ARHS">Autonomous Robot Hockey System</a> â€“ Autonomous Robot Hockey System (ARHS) - A ROS-based multi-robot system enabling autonomous robots to compete in strategic hockey-like gameplay. Uses sensor fusion (RPlidar laser scanner + Kinect RGB-D camera) for robust object detection, classification, and localization. Implements intelligent navigation with potential field-based motion planning, obstacle avoidance, and precise field mapping using geometric pole arrangements. Features state machine architecture for strategic behaviors including team coordination, dynamic target selection, puck manipulation, and goal scoring against opponents.

#### Other projects
- object detection & path planning on Pioneer-3DX mobile robot platform
- racecar Laptime Simulation in ChassisSim
